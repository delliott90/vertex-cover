# vertex-cover
Class project for my Athabasca algorithms course

The program accepts two parameters, one for the number of edges in the graph and one for maximum target vertex cover. They are entered in the form...

java VertexCover edgeCount coverTarget

java VertexCover 11 4

You will find the code in the Vertex-Cover folder. Navigate to that folder in a terminal before running the program.
